# This repository renders the website of the DigitalWorlds github organization

https://digitalworlds.github.io/

## How it works

The website is organized in a simple way by keeping the data entries in separate files. This makes it easy to add or modify content by using the github web editor.

1. The textual data of the website are stored in XML format.
2. The corresponding images are stored inside the img folder.
3. The layout and rendering of the website is done in XSLT.
4. Style files are located inside the style folder.

## Instructions

1. It is not recommended to edit any of the non-XML files unless you are tasked to re-styled the website.
2. Locate the corresponding XML file, such as `publications.xml`, `projects.xml`, `repositories.xml` and add an XML entry using as a guide the existing records.
3. Please make sure that the website still works after you made your edits and that your updated content is properly rendered.
4. If you accidentaly broke the website, please revert the changes by going back to a previous version.
